# Why This Exists

This tool automates part of the job search process by surfacing relevant opportunities programmatically — helping reclaim time and reduce cognitive fatigue caused by misleading listings.

## Features
	•	Basic job scraper/search tool
	•	Designed to be extended with filters and criteria
	•	WIP — originally intended as a framework for autonomous agents

Uses RapidAPI to search 2 major job posting sites, and 2 smaller ones. Free, as long as you stay under their rate limit. 

API endpoints are no longer functional as it's been a long time since I worked on this. 

I will revise shortly. 

## Disclaimer 

This tool was created for personal use and as a public service. It does not bypass authentication, violate TOS, or attempt to manipulate application systems.

I also didn't see much of a need to obfuscate my desired job title, experience level, desired base salary, and location using environmental variables. 3 out of those 4 are on my LinkedIn profile currently.
